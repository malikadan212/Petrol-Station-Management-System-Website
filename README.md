# **PetroPulse: Petrol Station Management System**  

## **Project Overview**  
PetroPulse is a comprehensive **Petrol Station Management System** designed to streamline and automate petrol station operations. The system supports features such as managing stations, workers, schedules, customers, fuel inventory, transactions, supplier relations, and more.  

Now built as a **full-stack web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**, PetroPulse ensures seamless data management, a dynamic user interface, and robust backend services.  

This project demonstrates modern **web development practices, RESTful API design, database management**, and an intuitive UI for ease of use.
